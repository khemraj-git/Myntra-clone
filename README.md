# Myntra Clone (HTML & CSS Only)

This project is a static clone of the Myntra website, built using only HTML and CSS. It aims to replicate the basic layout and visual style of Myntra's homepage.

**Note:** This is a static clone. It does not include any dynamic functionality (e.g., search, product filtering, cart functionality) or JavaScript.

## Features

* Replicates the basic layout of Myntra's homepage.
* Uses HTML and CSS for structure and styling.
* Demonstrates understanding of CSS layout techniques (e.g., Flexbox, Grid).
* Responsive design considerations (if you've implemented them).

## Technologies Used

* **HTML:** For structuring the web page.
* **CSS:** For styling the web page.

## How to Use

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [repository URL]
    ```
2.  **Open `index.html`:** Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Project Structure

* `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the Myntra clone.
* `style.css`: The CSS file containing the styling of the Myntra clone.
* `README.md`: This file, providing information about the project.
* `images/` (or `assets/`): Directory for storing images used in the clone.

## Implementation Details

* **HTML Structure:** The HTML structure is designed to mimic the layout of Myntra's homepage, using appropriate semantic HTML elements (e.g., `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`).
* **CSS Styling:** CSS is used to style the elements, replicating the visual style of Myntra. Flexbox and/or Grid are used for layout purposes.
* **Image Usage:** Images from Myntra's website (or similar placeholders) are used to represent product images and banners. (Ensure you respect copyright).
* **Responsiveness:** "The layout adapts to different screen sizes using CSS media queries." 

## Limitations

* **Static Content:** This is a static clone, so it does not have any interactive features.
* **No JavaScript:** The project does not use JavaScript, so it cannot handle dynamic content or user interactions.
* **Simplified Functionality:** This project focuses on replicating the visual layout, and does not include all the features of the actual Myntra website.
